Vesper.next
===========

This is the next version of the CAD-in-a-browser package called VESPER(Vectors In Specified Environments) that started in late 2012.

I will try to rewrite a ''critical mass'' of VESPER on top of paper.js instead of pure SVG. This re-write is largely undertaken due to suspected large speed impovements over SVG and other factors such as cross-browser compatibility and some more.
Vesper.next is built on top of paper.js using as the ''cake base'',  "Stylii": https://github.com/memononen/stylii




The ''Stylii'' upstream file is preserved as best as i could in its original form. Any changes are marked with ''UPSTREAM MODIFICATION''.
The ''v.next'' additional functionality is added in the v.next folder
